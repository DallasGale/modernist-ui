# Modernist UI

## What's the concept?

To be an opinionated component library that takes inspiration from Swiss modern design sensibilities. By restricting the main site palette/theme to only 3 colors; Dark, Light & Accent the components will tie together cohesively and give a sense of space.

## Theme/Mode
The mondernist.config.js file is where the 3 main modes or themes are set. All values have to be writted as HEX format values. ie: #000.

```javascript
theme: {
  accent: '#432432',
  dark: '#000000',
  light: '#ffffff',
}
```

These 3 theme settings should be all that's needed to personalise your site.

### Accent:
This is the 'pop' color or what is classically called the 'primary' color. Generally a color rather than grayscale. Can be applied to any component.

### Dark:
The negative space tone/color

### Light:
The positive space tone/color
